# Mastering C Language: From Fundamentals to DSA 🚀

Welcome to my C programming repository! This project is a comprehensive collection of my journey through the C language, featuring hands-on projects and algorithmic problem-solving.

## 🎯 Objective
The primary goal of this repository is to document my progress in mastering the **C programming language**. By focusing on low-level memory management, pointer manipulation, and efficient algorithm design, I have built a solid foundation for systems programming and software development.

## 🎓 About the Course
I have successfully completed the **[Skill Up C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/skill-up-c)** course by **GeeksforGeeks**. This course provided a structured path to understanding:
- Core syntax and control structures.
- Advanced concepts like Pointers, DMA (Dynamic Memory Allocation), and File Handling.
- Modular programming and preprocessor directives.
- Implementation of real-world logic through mini-projects.

## 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms in C
Beyond the fundamental syntax, I have dedicated a significant portion of this repository to **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. Implementing DSA in C is a unique challenge because it lacks built-in high-level libraries (like Python or Java), requiring me to:
- Manage memory manually using `malloc`, `calloc`, and `free`.
- Build complex structures like Linked Lists, Trees, and Graphs from scratch.
- Deeply understand how data is stored and accessed in RAM.

### Key DSA Implementations:
- **Linear Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular), Stacks, and Queues.
- **Non-Linear Data Structures**: Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), and Graphs.
- **Algorithms**: Searching (Linear/Binary), Sorting (Bubble, Merge, Quick, etc.), and Recursion.
